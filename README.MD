# 🤖 AI Agents in a Simulated Kabaddi Environment

### AI Assignment II - Ashish Mishra

This repository contains the full source code and analysis for a project designed to evaluate the performance of four distinct artificial intelligence agents in a custom, grid-based Kabaddi game simulation.

---

## 📜 Overview

This project explores the fascinating challenge of creating intelligent agents for a strategic game. The goal is to determine a near-optimal sequence of moves for a two-player team to capture an opponent's gold treasure and return it to their home base.

The solution implements and compares four powerful AI algorithms, each representing a different paradigm of decision-making:

-   **🧠 Random Agent:** A non-intelligent agent for baseline performance.
-   **💡 Greedy Agent:** A heuristic-driven agent that makes locally optimal choices.
-   **♟️ Alpha-Beta Search:** A classical search-based agent that plans several moves ahead.
-   **🎲 Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS):** A modern, simulation-based agent that uses probabilistic reasoning.

The agents were tested in two distinct environmental modes to analyze their adaptability:
1.  **Turn-Based Mode:** A deterministic, predictable environment.
2.  **Simultaneous-Move Mode:** An uncertain, complex environment where both teams act at once.

## ✨ Key Features

-   **Complete Game Environment:** A fully functional Kabaddi simulation with configurable rules and game modes.
-   **Four Distinct AI Agents:** From a simple baseline to advanced search and simulation algorithms.
-   **Dual Gameplay Modes:** A robust tournament framework to test agents in both turn-based and simultaneous-move scenarios.
-   **In-Depth Performance Analysis:** A detailed report and visual charts comparing the win, loss, and draw rates of all agent pairings.

## 📊 Key Result at a Glance

The core finding of this project is the critical impact of environmental uncertainty on agent performance. While the deterministic Alpha-Beta agent was unbeatable in the predictable turn-based mode, its advantage was completely nullified in the simultaneous mode, leading to strategic stalemates.

## 🚀 How to Run the Code

This project is implemented in **Python 3** and is designed to be run seamlessly in a **Google Colab** environment. No local installation of libraries is required.

### **Prerequisites**
-   A web browser.
-   A Google Account.

### **Execution Steps**

1.  **Open the Notebook in Google Colab**
    -   Navigate to the `Kabaddi_AI_Assignment.ipynb` file in this repository.
    -   Click the **"Open in Colab"** button at the top of the file viewer.

2.  **Run the Cells Sequentially**
    The notebook is structured into several cells that must be executed in order.

    -   **Cell 1: Environment Setup**
        -   **Purpose:** This cell uses the `%%writefile` command to create the `kabaddi_env.py` file, which defines all the game's rules and logic.
        -   **Action:** Run the cell.
        -   **Expected Output:** `Writing kabaddi_env.py`

    -   **Cell 2: Agent Implementation**
        -   **Purpose:** This cell creates the `agents.py` file, which contains the code for all four AI agents.
        -   **Action:** Run the cell.
        -   **Expected Output:** `Writing agents.py`

    -   **Cell 3 & 4: Tournament Execution**
        -   **Purpose:** These are the main scripts. Cell 3 runs the complete **Turn-Based Tournament**, and Cell 4 runs the **Simultaneous-Move Tournament**. They will simulate games for each of the 6 unique agent pairings and print the results.
        -   **Action:** Run Cell 3, wait for it to complete, then run Cell 4.
        -   **Expected Output:** A detailed log of the tournament progress will be printed, followed by the final summary tables.

        ```python
        --- Running Full Tournament: TURN Mode (50 games each) ---
        Starting Matchup: RandomAgent vs GreedyAgent...
        Matchup: RandomAgent (A) vs GreedyAgent (B)
          RandomAgent Wins: 0 (0%)
          GreedyAgent Wins: 38 (76%)
          Draws: 12 (24%)
        ------------------------------
        ... (and so on for all matchups)
        ```

📈 Analysis of Results
In the Turn-Based environment: The Alpha-Beta Search agent was unequivocally dominant. Its ability to plan ahead in a predictable environment allowed it to formulate unbeatable strategies.
In the Simultaneous-Move environment: Alpha-Beta's performance collapsed. The uncertainty of concurrent moves violated its core assumptions, forcing it into a risk-averse, defensive strategy that resulted in a massive increase in draws.
